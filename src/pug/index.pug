				.chapter-text
					p Audrey Hepburn was born in Brussels, Belgium, on May 4, 1929, in the family of Baroness Ella van Heemstra and a banker J. A. Hepburn-Ruston, who deserted the family when she was only eight years old. The early years family spent in England; when World War II had started Hepburn's mother took her to live with relatives in Holland, thinking they would be safer there. The Germans soon invaded Holland, though, leading to the deaths of many of Hepburn's relatives and forcing her and her mother to struggle just to stay alive. Sometimes she had nothing to eat except flour. Her envied slender figure was the result of being malnourished during adolescence.

				.chapter-text
					p During her screen test for Roman Holiday, Hepburn recalled performing ballet for audiences that were afraid to applaud because they didn't want the Nazis to catch them. She donated the money she earned from her recitals to the Resistance. Like many other Dutch children, she occasionally acted as a courier, delivering papers and money from one group of resistance workers to another. Children were given this work because the Nazis were unlikely to search them.

				.chapter-text
					p After the War Audrey Hepburn continued to study dancing, and in 1948 moved to London to take up a ballet scholarship with Ballet Rambert, which was then based in Notting Hill. She supported herself with part-time work as a model, and dropped "Ruston" from her surname. After she was told by Rambert that despite her talent, her height and weak constitution (the after-effect of wartime malnutrition) would make the status of prima ballerina unattainable, she decided to concentrate on acting.

					p She was cast in bit parts on stage and in films in both Holland and England before being discovered in 1952 by the French novelist Colette (1873–1954) in Monte Carlo, Monaco. Colette insisted that Hepburn play the lead role in the Broadway production of her novel #[em Gigi]. Although Hepburn's lack of experience was a problem at first, she improved steadily, and reviews of the show praised her performance. She also won a Theatre World Award for her work. This role also brought her to Hollywood’s attention.

				.chapter-text
					p During the shooting of Secret pople, where Audrey was playing a role of ballerina, she was spotted by director William Wyler. He was producing a film #[em Roman Holiday] and he felt the innocence and elfin beauty of Audrey Hepburn would make a perfect choice for the English Princess, who spends a day in Rome in the company of Gregory Peck. The film was a great hit and on the advertising Audrey Hepburn was given the same billing as Gregory Peck. In many respects, Audrey outshone her more illustrious lead Gregory Peck; as Peck predicted, it was Audrey who would be given an Oscar for her performance.

				.chapter-text
					p Following her success in Roman Holiday, Hepburn starred in Billy Wilder's romantic Cinderella-story comedy #[em Sabrina], in which wealthy brothers (Humphrey Bogart and William Holden) compete for the affections of their chauffeur's innocent daughter (Hepburn). The actress earned herself another Academy Award nomination for her role in the film—and also landed in a deep love affair with her co-star.
					p Even though Holden was 11 years her senior with a wife and three kids, Hepburn was deeply in love and desperately wanted marriage and children. After learning that Holden had undergone a vasectomy, Hepburn officially put an end to their relationship.

					h2.chapter-title The Style Icon
				.chapter-text
					p Audrey has become a worldwide symbol of style and elegance and the most ingenious quality about her sense of style is that she knew what looked good on her and what didn't. She's known for her simplicity and avoided fashion trends. She was featured on 7 September 1953 cover of TIME magazine, and also became noted for her personal style.
					p It was #[em Sabrina] movie that solidified her 40-year iconic relationship with French fashion designer, Hubert de Givenchy. Beginning in 1956, Audrey was perfectly outfitted from head to toe personally and professionally by the master couturier. Givenchy dressed Audrey in #[em Roman Holiday], #[em Breakfast at Tiffany’s], #[em Charade], and #[em My Fair Lady]. He also designed her beautiful hats and created a fragrance for her, an early celebrity collaboration.

				.chapter-text
					p Audrey's biggest dream of being mother became reality soon after her break-up with William Holden. Audrey met her first husband, the actor Mel Ferrer at a cocktail party hosted by mutual friend Gregory Peck. The meeting led them to collaborate in Ondine, during which they began a relationship. Eight months later they got married while preparing to star together in the film #[em War and Peace]. Their son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer, was born on 17 July 1960.
					p 14 years later, soon after divorcing Ferrer Hepburn met her second husband, Italian psychiatrist Andrea Dotti, on a Mediterranean cruise with friends in June 1968. They married in 6 month, and their son Luca Dotti was born a year after. This marriage lasted thirteen years and was dissolved in 1982.

				.chapter-text
					p Audrey had previously been married twice, both relationships formed over a common interest. Her third and greatest love, Robert Wolders, began no differently — both had experienced tragedy in their life, and both wanted to help people. They had both acted and both decided they preferred the simpler life. Wolders and Hepburn were together from 1980 until her death in 1993. When asked why he never proposed, Wolders says that they never felt the need.
					p Wolders adds: #[em “She viewed us as being married. There were times in order to avoid confusion that she would present me as, ‘My husband, Rob,’ but never as, ‘my partner,’ or, ‘my life partner,’ or anything like that. What always pleased me or always sounded so nice was, ‘Have you met my Rob?’ Or, ‘This is my Rob.'”]

					h2.chapter-title The UNICEF Ambassador
				.chapter-text
					p From 1967, after 15 years in film, Audrey acted only occasionally. She spent more time with her family and also working with UNICEF, which proved more meaningful to her than restarting her acting career. Audrey represented the agency in many capacities, not only appearing at public occasions to support the good cause of UNICEF but also traveling widely to the world's trouble spots to assess the situation of children. She would visit such locales as Ethiopia, the Sudan, El Salvador, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. When she wasn't visiting these countries, she helped raise funds for UNICEF. About her work for Unicef, Audrey also would say: 'I've been auditioning my whole life for this role, and I finally got it.'
					p Audrey served as Goodwill Ambassador for United Nations International Chidren's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), from 1988 until her untimely death of cancer in January 1993.
